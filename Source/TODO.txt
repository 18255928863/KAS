IMPORTANT:
- Connector rot differs by 90 in Locked vs plugged mode. BUG/UX
- Winch eject function. PARITY
- Support harppons, etc PARITY
- There is a big difference in the cable strength when it's almost 0 deployed and actually 0 deployed. Wicnh. UX
- Cleanup localization strings in all the modules RELEASE.
- Make KSP style fun descriptions of the parts. RELEASE
- Make RU localization. RELEASE

- Load Winch GUI settinsg from settings. UX

- If cable is stretched, cannot grab the conenctor due to distance - UX/BUG
  protected string CheckLengthLimit(ILinkSource source, ILinkTarget target) {
    //FIXME: in case of linked, conisder length not greater than existing. Don't block on simple check.

- Use regular cable joint in PCB components. STYLE/COMPATIBILITY
- Support (or check if works) physicsless parts in the joints - PERF
- Implement proper config of the menus in pipe model, or simple allow it be rotated up/down (TJ1-TJ2). UX
- make feature to see the compatible targets when a key is pressed (and a conenctor is being carried UX
- support blocked mode in winch. FR
- support dependent node in winch. FR
- Properly handle extend (unlcok from wicnh) event on a non-powered winch. How? UX
- stop locking modules on link state (allow multiple source/targets per a part). UX
- show updates om the connectors state and cable length in the status messages. UX
- refactor winch to handle things in the state handlers instead of overrides. STYLE

- BUG: Winch connector on detach doesnt handle collisions to the former target part
  - To reproduce it load a vessel with JS and Winch on the same vessel. UX

- Globally drop the properties setters in favor of the setting mthods (can be virtual).
- LINK JOINT: exclusiveDocker - allow only this part to maintain the coupling role. The others should reset with no option to set.
- LINK JOINT: noCouplingDelegation - don't delegate the coupling role for the mode above. Drop all other links on decouple.
- ILinkPeer FindLinkPeer(ILinkPeer srcPeer): add parameter to report errors


- Figure out why the connector gets broken on the broken cable joint.
- Implement hollow method in the renderer
- Handle link mass via joint instead of renderer in non-stock joints.

ILinkRenderer:
  /// FIXME: deprecate the property in favor of SetFixedLength.
  /// FIXME: adjust the cable link module accordingly.
  float stretchRatio { get; set; }

IWinchControl
  //FIXME: provide the real cable length too
  //FIXME: provide the cable joint
  /// FIXME: what if the motor cannot go?
  float motorTargetSpeed { get; }
  /// FIXME: add comments with regard how the speed is changed
  void SetMotor(float targetSpeed);

  public override void OnPartDie() {
    base.OnPartDie();
    // Make sure the connector is locked into the winch to not leave it behind.

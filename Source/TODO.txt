- Fix joint restore on timewarp!!!
- Use own target module on JS for the winch. It has coupling but is cable.
- Implement hiding option on the peers coupling nodes. All related nodes have to be hidden. Can be a pain.
- Use rnederer to ajdust the pipes offset. Maybe change its implemenbntation.
- Handle pre-attached parts on the peer's coupling node. Both in editor and in flight.

- Winch connector on detach doesnt handle collisions to the former target part
  - To reproduce it load a vessel with JS and Winch on the same vessel.
- Figure out why the connector gets broken on the broken cable joint.
- Restore the link on the winch to the parent!
- Nagging deployment of the connector in gravity.
- Migrate winch to the headed renderer.
- Support physics in the headed joint.

- Implement hollow method in the renderer
- Handle link mass via joint instead of renderer in non-stock joints.
- Move kerbal module hotkeys into a global config when there is one implemented.
  - Deal with the multiple kerbal target modules: only one of them can have a focus on the connector.

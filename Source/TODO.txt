BUG:
- On new KSP locking momemnetum is too high when retracting. conenctor mass too high? Only happens to the preatatched winches.


IMPORTANT:
- Implement proper config of the menus in pipe model, or simple allow it be rotated up/down (TJ1-TJ2). COMPATIBILITY
- Use regular cable joint in PCB components. STYLE/COMPATIBILITY

- support blocked mode in winch. FR
- support dependent node in winch. FR
- Properly handle extend (unlcok from wicnh) event on a non-powered winch. How? UX
- stop locking modules on link state (allow multiple source/targets per a part). UX
- show updates om the connectors state and cable length in the status messages. UX
- refactor winch to handle things in the state handlers instead of overrides. STYLE

- BUG: Winch connector on detach doesnt handle collisions to the former target part
  - To reproduce it load a vessel with JS and Winch on the same vessel. UX

- Globally drop the properties setters in favor of the setting mthods (can be virtual).
- LINK JOINT: exclusiveDocker - allow only this part to maintain the coupling role. The others should reset with no option to set.
- LINK JOINT: noCouplingDelegation - don't delegate the coupling role for the mode above. Drop all other links on decouple.


- Figure out why the connector gets broken on the broken cable joint.
- Restore the link on the winch to the parent!
- Nagging deployment of the connector in gravity.
- Migrate winch to the headed renderer.
- Support physics in the headed joint.

- Implement hollow method in the renderer
- Handle link mass via joint instead of renderer in non-stock joints.
- Move kerbal module hotkeys into a global config when there is one implemented.
  - Deal with the multiple kerbal target modules: only one of them can have a focus on the connector.


ILinkRenderer:
  /// FIXME: deprecate the property in favor of SetFixedLength.
  /// FIXME: adjust the cable link module accordingly.
  float stretchRatio { get; set; }

# KAS pre-release for KSP 1.1

Please, note that **this is not a playing version**. Do not install it unless your intention is
testing and reporting bugs in the pre-release. If your intention is to play 1.1 with favorite
mods then installing this pre-release is a bad choice: your game experience may get ruined due
to bugs and undetermined behavior of the test code.

### How to install KSP 1.1 via Steam

- Make a full backup of the existing game. Nobody guaranties your savefiles won't be
broken.
- Go to `Kerbal Space Program / Properties / Betas` and choose "prerelease"
([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/8L5l1Sp.png)). Once Steam is done uploading to the new version
go into the game's folder and drop all your mods. Most of them won't work anyways but they may
interfere with the new KIS/KAS.
- Install latest pre-release builds of KIS/KAS from the development forum the thread (TBD).

### Building for KSP 1.1

- Follow building instructions from `BUILD.md`.
- To avoid the versions mess map 1.0.5 backup to a logical drive `R:` and adjust project settings
accordingly.
- Run versions from the file explorer instead of Steam.
